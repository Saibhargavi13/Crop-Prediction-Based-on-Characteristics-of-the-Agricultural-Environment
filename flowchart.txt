1.importing the packages
2.exploring the dataset - crop recommendation data
3.data processing and cleaning
4.visualization the data using seaborn and matplotlib
5.Splitting the data to train and test
6.building the model with and without feature selection
	- Feature Selection (SMOTE, ROSE, RFE, MRFE, BORUTA, MEMOTE)
	- KNN
	- Naive Bayes
	- Bagging Classifeir
	- Random Forest
	- Decision Tree
	- SVM
	- Gradient Boosting
	- Voting Classifier
   
7.training the model
8.building the model with Voting Classifier since it gives better accuracy comparing with Other Models 
9.Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
10.importing the packages
11.User gives input as Feature Values 
12.the given input is preprocessed for prediction
13.trained model is used for prediction
14.final outcome is displayed through frontend

Note:

Extension - Voting Classifier, Gradient Boosting is build as Extension for feature values
used for prediction since we it gives better accuracy around 100% comparing with other Models
