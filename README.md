# Crop-Prediction-Based-on-Characteristics-of-the-Agricultural-Environment
This project aims to enhance agricultural productivity by predicting the most suitable crops based on environmental characteristics such as soil properties, climate, and rainfall patterns. By leveraging this data, farmers can make informed decisions, optimize crop selection, and improve yield efficiency.
